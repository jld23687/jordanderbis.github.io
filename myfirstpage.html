<h2>Why adopt a dog from a shelter as opposed to a pet store?</h2>
<p>Shelters all over the country are practically bursting at the seams with a surplus of stray dogs and cats in need of loving homes. An estimated <a href=https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics>6.5 million</a> domesticated animals enter the U.S. animal shelters each year. However, because many shelters are often overrun with excess animals, and because many receive poor funding and resources, approximately <a href=https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics>1.5 million</a> shelter animals are euthanized each year. 
</p>

<p> Not only that, but the animals in most commercial pet stores come from puppy mills, which are essentially factories for the manufacturing of puppies of “desirable” breeds. From birth to their placement in a pet store window, most of these animals are severely mistreated, malnourished, and live in generally poor conditions. As a result of overbreeding, many animals from these mills have severe health complications that owners are often not informed of at the time of adoption.
